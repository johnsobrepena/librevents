# Configuring Librevents

Librevents can be configured in two primary ways:

## 1. YAML Configuration Files

Librevents uses YAML files to define its configuration, and these files can be customized based on the messaging
technology you choose.

- The default configuration is located in `server/src/main/resources/application.yml`.
- Additional configurations are provided for specific messaging technologies, such as:
    - `application-kafka.yml`
    - `application-rabbitmq.yml`
    - `application-sqs.yml`
- You can override these configurations by
  using [Spring Profiles](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.profiles)
  to load the appropriate file automatically. Alternatively, you can manually specify a profile when running Librevents.
- To customize settings, place an `application.yml` file alongside your built JAR. This will overlay the default values
  from the included configuration files.

## 2. Environment Variables

You can override any YAML-defined property using environment variables. Librevents supports Spring Boot’s syntax for
environment variable expansion, meaning many properties are defined as:

```yaml
property.name: ${ENV_VARIABLE:defaultValue}
```

This allows you to configure the application dynamically without modifying YAML files, making it easier to deploy in
different environments.

> **Note**: You can use the `setup_env.sh` script to set up environment variables automatically before running
> Librevents.
> This
> simplifies the configuration process by loading predefined variables into your shell session.

For more details on available configuration properties, refer to the documentation or the default YAML files in the
`server/src/main/resources` directory.

## INFURA Support Configuration

Connecting to an INFURA node is only supported if connecting via websockets (`wss://<...>` node url). The block strategy
must also be set to PUBSUB.

# Advanced

## Correlation ID Strategies (Kafka Broadcasting)

Each subscribed event can have a correlation id strategy association with it, during subscription. A correlation id
strategy defines what the kafka message key for a broadcast event should be, and allows the system to be configured so
that events with particular parameter values are always sent to the same partition.

Currently supported correlation id strategies are:

**Indexed Parameter Strategy** - An indexed parameter within the event is used as the message key when broadcasting.
**Non Indexed Parameter Strategy** - An non-indexed parameter within the event is used as the message key when
broadcasting.

## Event Store

Librevents utilises an event store in order to establish the block number to start event subscriptions from, in the
event
of a failover. For example, if the last event broadcast for event with id X had a block number of 123, then on a
failover, librevents will subscribe to events from block 124.

There are currently 2 supported event store implementations:

#### MongoDB

Broadcast events are saved and retrieved from a mongoDB database.

**Required Configuration**

| Env Variable             | Default   | Description                 |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| EVENT_STORE_TYPE         | DB        | MongoDB event store enabled |
| SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST | localhost | The mongoDB host            |
| SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_PORT | 27017     | The mongoDB post            |

#### REST Service

Librevents polls an external REST service in order to obtain a list of events broadcast for a specific event
specification. It is assumed that this REST service listens for broadcast events on the kafka topic and updates its
internal state...broadcast events are not directly sent to the REST service by librevents.

The implemented REST service should have a pageable endpoint which accepts a request with the following specification:

- **URL:** Configurable, defaults to `/api/rest/v1/event`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:**

| Key          | Value            |
|--------------|------------------|
| content-type | application/json |

- **URL Params:**

| Key       | Value                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| page      | The page number                                    |
| size      | The page size                                      |
| sort      | The results sort field                             |
| dir       | The results sort direction                         |
| signature | Retrieve events with the specified event signature |

- **Body:** `N/A`

- **Success Response:**
    - **Code:** 200
      **Content:**

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "blockNumber": 10,
      "id": "<unique event id>"

## Integrating Librevents into Third Party Spring Application

Librevents can be embedded into an existing Spring Application via an annotation.

#### Steps to Embed

1. Add the GitHub Packages repository to your `pom.xml` file:

    ```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>github-librevents</id>
            <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/IoBuilders/librevents</url>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ```

2. Add authentication for GitHub Packages by including your GitHub token in your `settings.xml` file (typically located
   in `~/.m2/settings.xml`):

    ```xml
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>github-librevents</id>
            <username>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
            <password>YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    ```

3. Add the `librevents-core` dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.librevents</groupId>
        <artifactId>librevents-core</artifactId>
        <version>*LATEST_LIBREVENTS_VERSION*</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

4. Within your Application class or a `@Configuration` annotated class, add the `@EnableLibrevents` annotation.

#### Health check endpoint

Librevents offers a healthcheck url where you can ask for the status of the systems you are using. It will look like:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "rabbit": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "version": "3.7.13"
      }
    },
    "mongo": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "version": "4.0.8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Returning this information it is very easy to create alerts over the status of the system.

The endpoint is: GET /monitoring/health
